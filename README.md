# RetroSync

Something to keep in mind before using: <br />
-Enter your Pi's IP address in line 15 (Recommend using a static IP!)<br />
-Remove any special characters from game file's name when saving
any game files to either RetroPie or RetroArch file directory. (Trying to
figure out a way around this T.T)<br />
-IMPORTANT: Need to have ssh key pre-authenticated with RetroPie to be able to setup cron job<br />
